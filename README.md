# My Take on YouTube Using React

This is my implementation of a shared YouTube playlist application using React. It allows users to create playlists, share them with others, and add videos to the playlist collaboratively. The application supports a variety of features designed to enhance the user experience while interacting with YouTube content.

## Features

### Core Features:
- **Play YouTube Videos**: Users can play YouTube videos within the app.
- **Video Details**: View detailed information about each video, including the description, title, and view count.
- **Search Videos**: Users can search for videos even while watching the current one.
- **Add Videos to Playlist**: Search and add videos to your playlist.
- **Remove Videos from Playlist**: Easily remove videos from the playlist.
- **Share Playlists**: Each playlist has a unique URL that users can share with others. The content of the playlist is synchronized across all users.
- **Playlist Autoplay**: The next video in the playlist automatically starts playing once the current one finishes.
- **Next/Prev Video Buttons**: Navigate through the playlist using next and previous buttons.
- **Animations**: Using **Framer Motion**, the app includes smooth animations, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Extra Features:
- **Random Grid Layout**: Implemented a dynamic random grid layout where elements are automatically appended to the topmost available position in the grid.
- **Video Recommendations**: While a video is playing, the app suggests related videos based on the current video.
- **Thumbnail Animation**: Cool animation effects when video thumbnails appear on the screen.
